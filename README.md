## Synopsis

This is a Virtual Gujarati Keyboard. It is a base prototype of Gujarati Keyboard, which will be embedded in a browser as an extension. So that Gujarati typing becomes easy.

## Motivation

Google Translator provides an excellent Gujarati-Keyboard with 3 modes.

1. **Normal Mode**

    Keys are available which are displayed on the keyboard.
2. **Shift Mode**

    Hiddent keys are available after pressing Shift.
3. **Ctrl+Alt Mode**

    Hiddent keys are available after pressing Ctrl+Alt.
    
But the **problem** with the modes of the Keyboard provided by Google Translator is:

*  So many keys are left blank which are of no use, which eventually increases the modes.
  
    This can be solved by inserting ***Ctrl+Alt Mode*** keys at the blank spaces of ***Normal Mode*** and ***Shift Mode***, which leads to the reduction in number of modes. 

##Contributors
